% No-Reference Feature Function (NRFF)
%  Implement standard NRFF function calls.
% 
%  This NRFF measures quality loss associated with a loss of fine detail.
%  This may be caused by too aggressive noise reduction, or image resizing. 
%  Small edges are analyzed by comparison to large edges.
%
%  This algorithms emphasizes calculation speed and simplicity.
% 
% SYNTAX & SEMANTICS
%   See 'calculate_NRpars' for interface specifications.
