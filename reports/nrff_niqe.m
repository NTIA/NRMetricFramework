function [data] = nrff_niqe(mode, varargin)

% No-Reference Feature Function (NRFF)
%
%
% Calculates the NIQE score as detailed in the paper, "A. Mittal, R.
% Soundararajan and A. C. Bovik, "Making a Completely Blind Image Quality Analyzer", submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2012.
% 
% To calculate NIQE score, go to URL:
% https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/Quality/index_algorithms.htm 
% and download the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) code. Note
% that there is an option to download code for IL-NIQE, which is NOT the
% algorithm that was evaluated in this study. 
%
% Unzip the folder 'niqe_release' and place it in your MATLAB project path
% to ensure that this function is able to access the proper variables
% and functions
