## Other Organization NR Metric Reports 

The NRMetricFramework contains code for no reference (NR) metrics that were developed and published by other organizations. This directory (reports) contains the no reference feature functions (NRFF) for these metrics. 

If the metric requires a set of MATLAB functions other than the NRFF file, these files are placed in a sub-directory with that metric's name. That sub-directory must be added to the path.

The developer and software licencse terms are identified in the NRFF file. 

Performance reports for these metrics can be found in the documents directory. The naming convention is "Reports" followed by the metric name.
